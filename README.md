# 1-Year Habit Tracker

This project is a simple and interactive habit tracker designed to help users track their daily habits for an entire year. Users can set up to three habits for each month and mark their progress day by day on a **printed copy of the calendar**.

This habit tracker is my **first project as a UX Designer**, where I am upskilling and teaching myself to automate designs and solutions for users' needs.

## Features
- **Customizable Habits**: Users can enter up to three habits for each month in the provided input fields.
- **Printable Calendar**: The layout is optimized for users to print and manually track their daily progress.
- **Lightweight Design**: Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring fast loading and ease of use.
